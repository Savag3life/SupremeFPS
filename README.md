## Supreme FPS Boost
This is just a quick project I created while testing some optimizations in an upcoming Spigot project. It utilizes [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) to filter some packets from being sent to the client to increase FPS while rendering changes.

## Build
This project is built on Lombok, Maven, and the Spigot API.

To Build run`mvn clean install`
